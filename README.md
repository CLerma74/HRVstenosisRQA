Database of short-term heart rate variability (HRV) recordings and echocardiographic parameters obtained from 27 patients with moderate and severe aortic valve stenosis (AVS). The database includes linear and nonlinear HRV indices acquired under controlled resting conditions, along with clinical and echocardiographic measures of disease severity, including mean transvalvular pressure gradient (mPG) and indexed aortic valve area (AVAi). These data were used for the manuscript entitled “Correlation between Aortic Valve Stenosis Severity and Heart Rate Variability Indices Based on Recurrence Quantification Analysis” by Itayetzin Beurini Cruz-Vega, Nydia Ávila-Vanzzini, Gertrudis H. González-Gómez, Juan C. Echeverría, and Claudia Lerma.
